<!-- This is a comment -->
<p><q>The Soft Coated Wheaten Terrier</q> is an exuberant Irish farm dog, is happy, friendly, deeply devoted, and just stubborn enough to remind you he's a terrier.<br>The unique wheaten coat is low-shedding but needs diligent care to avoid matting. The hallmark of these merry extroverts, and what sets them apart from<br>other terriers, is the silky, gently waving coat.It runs from a pale beige to a shimmering gold, recalling the color of ripening wheat.Topping out at 19 inches<br> tall and 40 pounds, Wheatens are square, sturdy terriers with a peek-a-boo hairdo and dashing goatee. The overall picture is that of a hard-muscled but<br> soft-coated working terrier or, as the breed has been described, an iron fist in a velvet glove.</p>

<h1 style="text-align:center;"font-family:verdana;">History</h1>
<p>Among Ireland's gifts to civilization are reams of great literature, a mighty smooth whiskey, and three magnificent long-legged terriers'¿the Wheaten, Kerry<br>Blue, and Irish. All share a common ancestry and were bred for similar purposes. As versatile farm dogs, Wheatens were expected to do any number of rustic<br> chores, like ratting, guarding the chicken coop, and even herding or bird-dogging. When day was done they were engaging fireside companions, a role they<br> still relish'¿even if the hearth has been replaced by a TV.</p>

Dogs should always be supervised for interactions and introductions with other dogs, but some<br> breeds are innately more likely to get along with other dogs, both at home and in public.</blockquote>
